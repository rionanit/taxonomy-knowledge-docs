The track "Lunch" was released as the lead single concurrently.

Background and recording

Eilish co-wrote and recorded her second studio album, Happier Than Ever, at her brother Finneas O'Connell's home recording studio, located in the basement of his Los Angeles residence.[3] Recording took place weekly between April 2020 and February 2021, with the track listing finalized by the duo during the album's creation.[4][5] Released on July 30, 2021,[6] Happier Than Ever was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, topping the Billboard 200[7] and nominated twice at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.[8] Eilish surprise-released her second extended play (EP) Guitar Songs in July 2022. The following year, she released "What Was I Made For?" for the soundtrack to the fantasy-comedy film Barbie (2023); she was inspired to write the song after seeing unfinished scenes of the film during its production.[9] The song won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media.[10]

In December 2021, Eilish began formulating ideas for her third studio album with O'Connell.[11] In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, she mentioned that she hoped to start writing the album in 2023.[12] In December 2023, Eilish said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that the album was "almost done".[13] Three months later, she confirmed that the album had been mastered.[14]

The album art, which was shot by underwater photographer William Drumm,[15] depicts Eilish falling through a door frame into dark blue water. Eilish described the photoshoot, which took six hours to complete and involved her being repeatedly submerged for two minutes at a time with a weight attached to her shoulders and without goggles or nose plugs,[16] as being one of the most painful experiences of her life.[17][16]
Promotion and release

Various news articles reported billboards teasing snippets of lyrics for the album that appeared in multiple cities in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States in April 2024;[18] although it does not mention the artist's name, her signature "blohsh" was recognized.[19][a] The promotional billboards display cryptic lyrics, such as "She's the headlights I'm the deer" or "Did I cross the line?".[21] Eilish later changed her profile picture to a "blue circle" and shared another image with the caption saying "Do you know how to bend?".[22] Eilish added her followers to an Instagram feature that lets limited accounts see exclusive stories, called "Close Friends". The post features a "lo-fi" image showcasing the artist's hand,[23] and an image of her new midriff tattoo.[24] On April 29, 2024, Eilish announced Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour, her seventh concert tour, in support of the album. The tour is set to start on September 29, 2024, at the Videotron Centre in Quebec City, Canada.[25] The 2025 leg of the tour is set to start on February 18, at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre.

Eilish previewed the songs "Lunch", "L'Amour de Ma Vie", and "Chihiro" during a surprise DJ set at Coachella on April 13, 2024.[26] In an interview published on April 24, she told Rolling Stone that she would not release singles prior to the album's release. She explained that she does not like singles from albums because she "really [doesn't] like when things are out of context" and compared Hit Me Hard and Soft to "a family", adding that she "[doesn't] want one little kid in the middle of the room alone".[27] In May, a preview of "Chihiro" was featured in a Fortnite trailer revealing Eilish's second in-game outfit. The song was also made available as a "Jam Track" to use in the Fortnite Festival mode alongside "Lunch" and "The Diner".[28][29] Furthermore, a snippet of "Birds of a Feather" was featured in a promotional clip for the third season of the Netflix series Heartstopper.[30] On May 15 and May 16, Eilish held a listening party events for fans respectively at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and Kia Forum in Inglewood, in both cases premiering the album in its entirety.[31]

Writing for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis complimented Hit Me Hard and Soft's "beautiful" melodies and "distinctive" lyrical touches, but wondered if some of its elements could be "a little too opaque" for its own good.[45] NME's Thomas Smith felt that although Eilish wrote the album for herself, she created a record that will "resonate harder" than anything she has done before.[48]
